        What is k value?

      <p>
        "k" typically refers to the number of nearest neighbors used in various
        algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN). KNN is a type of
        instance-based learning or lazy learning, where the function is only
        approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function
        evaluation. In KNN, "k" is a hyperparameter that represents the number
        of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction. The choice of
        the value of "k" in KNN can significantly affect the performance of the
        model. A smaller value of "k" (e.g., 1 or 3) can result in a more
        sensitive model to local variations, but it may also introduce more
        noise. A larger value of "k" (e.g., 10 or 20) can provide a smoother
        decision boundary but might overlook finer patterns in the data. The
        appropriate value of "k" often needs to be determined through
        experimentation and model evaluation using techniques such as
        cross-validation to find the optimal value that yields the best
        predictive performance for the specific dataset and problem you are
        working on.
